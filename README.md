# Metatron
### StealthBot Reborn

Metatron is a bot for the game EVE Online that is designed to be a replacement for StealthBot, which is no longer maintained. It requires both Innerspace and ISXEVE to run.

## Features

* **Fleet Management** - Metatron can manage fleets, including broadcasting fleet commands, accepting fleet invites, and joining fleets.
* **Ratting** - Metatron can kill NPCs, including using drones.
* **Salvaging** - Metatron can salvage wrecks, loot containers, and use tractor beams.
* **Freighting** - Metatron can haul items between stations.
* **Combat Assist** - Metatron can run only combat modules, including using drones, allowing the player to retain navigation control. This is useful for missions and wormhole combat sites.
* **Missions!!!** - Metatron can run any and all missions types, with most missions being supported out of the box. Please see below for unsupported missions.
