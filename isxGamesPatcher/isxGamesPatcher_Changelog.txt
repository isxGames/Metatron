 20070309.02 - CyberTech
	- Add header lines to disable caching and to bypass existing caching of downloaded files -- xml file still needs done!
	- Add header to disable keepalive

	- Propagate HTTP and TCP errors to the error event msg.
	- Add a few delays in dll unload/reload to try to fix an issue with dll missing event (assumption)
	- Tidy output a bit
	- Add more exception handling for the http request (host missing, down, etc)
	
 20070308.05 - CyberTech
 	- Added ability to create subdirectories as specified by the <filename> component in the patcher
	- Misc output changes
	- Added <PerformBackup>(0 or 1)</PerformBackup>
		Allows the script author to disable backups of certain files, for which it makes no sense to do backups,
		for example, changelogs, dll's, etc.
	- Added <Project> section to xml file.
		<Project>
			<Name>My Project</Name>
			<Author>Joe Somebody</Author>
			<Event_FileUpdated>myscript_OnFileUpdated</Event_FileUpdated>
			<Event_UpdateError>myscript_OnUpdateError</Event_UpdateError>
			<Event_UpdateComplete>myscript_OnUpdateComplete</Event_UpdateComplete>
		</Project>
	- Added Manifest-Configurable Event Specification to <Project> block
		<Event_FileUpdated>myproject_OnFileUpdated</Event_FileUpdated>
		<Event_UpdateError>myproject_OnUpdateError</Event_UpdateError>
		<Event_UpdateComplete>myproject_OnUpdateComplete</Event_UpdateComplete>
		
		<Event_UpdateComplete>
			This event will fire when the patcher is completely done.  It is specified only at the <Project> level, 
			not at the <FileInfo> level.
			Default Event: "isxGamesPatcher_onUpdateComplete"
		Event_FileUpdated
			This will pass the name of the file that was updated as a parameter.  Note 
			that you could have a different event for each file, if you wanted.
			Default: "isxGamesPatcher_onFileUpdated"
		Event_UpdateError
			This will pass the error, in the case of a problem parsing the manifest file,
			downloading files, etc.  Probably not needed, for most scripts.
			Default: "isxGamesPatcher_onUpdateError"
			
		Note: 
			When listening for these events in your script, you must register the event, since
			the patcher won't be running yet to have registered it.
